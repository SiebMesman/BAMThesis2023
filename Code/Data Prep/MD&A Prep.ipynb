Overview We recorded a net loss of $282 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, as compared to a net loss of $586 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. Our net loss in 2009 was primarily the result of the global recession. Excluding special items, we recorded a net loss of $295 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, compared to a net loss of $352 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. Net loss excluding special items is significant because it provides management and investors the ability to measure and monitor our performance on a consistent basis. Special items relate to activities that are not central to our ongoing operations or are unusual in nature. A reconciliation of our net loss to the non GAAP financial measure of net loss excluding special items is provided in Item 6. Selected Financial Data. 2009 Financial Highlights Passenger revenue decreased 18.9% during 2009 as compared to 2008, primarily due to lower fares and less high yield business traffic attributable to the global recession. Operating income (loss), a key measure of our performance, improved to a loss of $146 million in 2009 compared to a $314 million loss in 2008, primarily due to lower fuel prices offset by lower revenue. We raised approximately $1.7 billion through the issuance of common stock, enhanced equipment trust certificates and convertible debt and through other new secured borrowings. Unrestricted cash, cash equivalents and short term investments totaled $2.9 billion at December 31, 2009, as compared to $2.6 billion at December 31, 2008. 2009 Operational Highlights We joined Star Alliance on October 27, 2009. Consolidated traffic decreased 3.8% and capacity decreased 5.2% during 2009 as compared to 2008, resulting in a consolidated load factor of 81.4%, 1.2 points higher than the prior year consolidated load factor. We recorded a DOT on time arrival rate of 78.8% for Continental mainline flights and a mainline segment completion factor of 99.5% for 2009, compared to a DOT on time arrival rate of 74.0% and a mainline segment completion factor of 98.9% for 2008. We also operated 101 days without a single mainline flight cancellation. We placed into service 13 new Boeing 737 900ER, one new Boeing 737 800 and one leased Boeing 757 300 aircraft and removed 20 Boeing 737 300 and eight Boeing 737 500 aircraft from our mainline fleet. The average age of our mainline fleet was nine years at December 31, 2009. Outlook The severe global economic recession significantly diminished the demand for air travel beginning in the fourth quarter of 2008 and disrupted the global capital markets, resulting in a difficult financial environment for U.S. network carriers. Although we have seen some indications that the airline industry may be experiencing the early stages of a recovery, we cannot predict how quickly or fully demand for air travel will recover, and continued weakness in such demand would hinder our ability to achieve and sustain profitability. Moreover, although access to the capital markets has improved over the past several months, as evidenced by our recent financing transactions, we cannot give any assurances that we will be able to obtain additional financing or otherwise access the capital markets in the future on acceptable terms (or at all). We must achieve and sustain profitability and or access the capital markets to meet our significant long term debt and capital lease obligations and future commitments for capital expenditures, including the acquisition of aircraft and related spare engines. Economic Conditions. The severe economic recession in the U.S. and global economies has had a significant negative impact on the demand for air carrier services beginning in the fourth quarter of 2008. Passenger revenue in 2009 for U.S. airlines, as reported by the Air Transport Association of America, declined 18% compared to 2008. The decline in demand for air travel in 2008 and 2009 disproportionately reduced the volume of high yield traffic, as many business travelers either curtailed their travel or purchased lower yield economy tickets. Although recent improvements in corporate bookings and revenue trends suggest that the airline industry may be experiencing the early stages of a recovery, we cannot predict how quickly or fully demand for air travel will recover. If global economic conditions fail to improve or worsen, resulting in continuing demand weakness and reduced revenues, we may be unable to offset the reduced revenues fully through further cost and capacity reductions or other measures. In addition to its effect on demand for our services, the global economic recession severely disrupted the global capital markets, resulting in a diminished availability of financing and higher cost for financing that was obtainable. Although access to the capital markets has improved over the past several months, as evidenced by our recent financing transactions, if economic conditions again worsen or these markets experience further disruptions, we may be unable to obtain financing on acceptable terms (or at all) to refinance certain maturing debt we would normally expect to refinance and to satisfy future capital commitments. Fuel Costs. We benefited from significantly lower fuel costs during 2009. Our average consolidated (mainline and regional) jet fuel price per gallon including related taxes decreased to $1.97 in 2009 from $3.27 in 2008. If fuel prices rise significantly from their current levels, we may be unable to raise fares or other fees sufficiently to offset fully our increased costs. In an effort to address the risk of rising fuel prices, we enter into fuel hedging arrangements from time to time, including collars that minimize the up front costs. However, a precipitous decline in crude oil prices, as experienced during the second half of 2008, may result in significant costs to us in cases where our hedging arrangements obligate us to make payments to the counterparties to the extent that the price of crude falls below the applicable agreed upon amounts. Our hedge contracts for 2009, which were largely entered into before oil prices fell, resulted in $0.23 per gallon of additional fuel expense during 2009. Based on our expected fuel consumption in 2010, a one dollar change in the price of a barrel of crude oil would change our annual fuel expense by approximately $41 million, assuming no changes to the refining margins and our fuel hedging program. We believe that our modern, fuel efficient fleet continues to provide us with a competitive advantage relative to our peers and a long term hedge against rising fuel prices. Revenue Generating and Cost Saving Measures. In response to the significant decline in revenue, we implemented a number of measures to raise revenues and reduce costs that are designed to achieve approximately $100 million in annual benefits when fully implemented in 2010. These measures included the elimination of certain operational, management and clerical positions across the company during 2009. We also increased or implemented fees for certain services we provide, including checked baggage. Going forward, we intend to offer additional goods and services relating to air travel that will permit customers to select product attributes that they wish to consume, and pay for, and not select other product attributes that they do not wish to consume or pay for. A portion of the goods and services will come from unbundling our current product, while another portion will come from goods and services that we do not currently offer. The revenue that we derive from these goods and services, which is generally referred to as ancillary revenue, typically has higher margins than that of our core product and is an important element of our strategy to return to profitability and sustain that profitability. Additionally, we will continue to invest in technology designed to assist customers with self service. We believe that many of our customers desire more control over their travel experience, and wish to use tools that will permit them to do so through all phases of travel, from pre purchase to post flight. We will also invest in technology designed to help us make better operational decisions and more efficiently assist customers at airports, while lowering our operating costs. Capacity. Because of the adverse economic conditions in 2009, we reduced our consolidated capacity by 5.2% in 2009 and rescheduled aircraft deliveries. We do not anticipate returning to significant capacity growth unless the level of demand for air travel, economic conditions and our financial performance improve sufficiently to justify such growth. We expect only modest capacity growth for 2010, with our consolidated capacity increasing between 1.0% and 2.0%. We expect our mainline capacity to increase between 1.5% and 2.5%, with mainline domestic capacity remaining about flat and mainline international capacity increasing between 4.0% and 5.0%. The international capacity increase is primarily due to the run rate of international routes added in 2009 and the restoration of our schedule to Mexico following our capacity reductions in 2009 related to the H1N1 flu virus. Our future ability to grow our capacity could be adversely impacted by manufacturer delays in aircraft deliveries. We currently expect the first of our 25 Boeing 787 aircraft to be delivered in the second half of 2011, approximately two and a half years late. Star Alliance. On October 27, 2009, we joined Star Alliance and implemented code sharing and reciprocity of frequent flier programs, elite customer recognition and airport lounge use with United, Lufthansa, Air Canada and other Star Alliance members. On July 10, 2009, the DOT approved our application to join United and a group of eight other carriers within Star Alliance that already hold antitrust immunity. This approval enables us, United and these other immunized Star Alliance carriers to work closely together to deliver highly competitive international flight schedules, fares and service and provides competitive balance to antitrust immunized carriers in SkyTeam. Additionally, we, United, Lufthansa and Air Canada have received final DOT approval to establish a trans Atlantic joint venture to create a more efficient and comprehensive trans Atlantic network for our respective customers, offering those customers more service, scheduling and pricing options and establishing a framework for similar joint ventures in other regions of the world. The DOTs approval of antitrust immunity is subject to certain conditions and limitations that are not expected to diminish materially the benefits of our participation in Star Alliance or the trans Atlantic joint venture. On December 23, 2009, we, United and ANA filed an application with the DOT for antitrust immunity to enable the three carriers to establish a trans Pacific joint venture, offering similar benefits to our trans Pacific customers. We are seeking a modification to our pilot collective bargaining agreement to permit us to engage in revenue sharing with a domestic air carrier, which is a component of the proposed joint ventures. The full implementation of some of the arrangements relating to Star Alliance requires the approval of domestic and foreign regulatory agencies. These agencies may deny us necessary approvals, delay certain approvals or, in connection with granting any such approvals, impose requirements, limitations or costs on us or on other Star Alliance members, or require us or them to divest slots, gates, routes or other assets. In certain cases, such actions could prevent us from consummating the transactions contemplated by our alliance agreements. Labor Costs. Our ability to achieve and sustain profitability also depends on continuing our efforts to implement and maintain a more competitive cost structure. Approximately 97% of our full time equivalent employees represented by unions as of December 31, 2009 are covered by collective bargaining agreements that are currently amendable or become amendable in 2010. In addition, on February 12, 2010, the National Mediation Board informed us that our fleet service employees had voted in favor of representation by the Teamsters. The election covers approximately 7,600 employees, or 6,340 full time equivalent ramp, operations and cargo agents. The collective bargaining agreements with our pilots, mechanics and certain other work groups became amendable in December 2008 and those with our flight attendants and CMI mechanics became amendable in December 2009. On July 6, 2009, our flight simulator technicians ratified a new four year collective bargaining agreement with us. With respect to our workgroups with amendable contracts, we have been meeting with representatives of the applicable unions to negotiate amended collective bargaining agreements with a goal of reaching agreements that are fair to us and to our employees, but to date the parties have not reached new agreements. Negotiations often take considerable time. For example, we began negotiating with our pilots union in February 2007, and we only received their first economic proposal in December 2009. We cannot predict the outcome of our ongoing negotiations with our unionized workgroups, although significant increases in the pay and benefits resulting from new collective bargaining agreements could have a material adverse effect on us. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that our generally good labor relations and high labor productivity can continue. Results of Operations Special Items. The comparability of our financial results between years is affected by a number of special items. Our results for each of the last three years include the following special items (in millions): Income (Expense) 2009 2008 2007 Operating (expense) income: Aircraft related charges (1) $ (89) $ (40) $ 22 Pension settlement charges (2) (29) (52) (31) Severance (1) (5) (34) Route impairment (3) (12) (18) Other (1) (10) (37) (4) Total special charges classified as operating items (145) (181) (13) Nonoperating (expense) income: Gains on sales of investments (4) 78 37 Loss on fuel hedge contracts with Lehman Brothers (5) (125) Other than temporary impairment of auction rate securities (6) (60) Fair value of auction rate securities put right received (6) 26 Total special non operating items (81) 37 Income tax benefit (expense): Intraperiod tax allocation (7) 158 NOL utilization (7) 28 (114) Total special items income (expense) $ 13 $(234) $ (90) (1) See Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8 of this report.

Comparison of Year Ended December 31, 2009 to December 31, 2008 Consolidated Results of Operations Significant components of our consolidated operating results for the year ended December 31 were as follows (in millions, except percentage changes): Increase % Increase 2009 2008 (Decrease) (Decrease) Operating revenue $12,586 $15,241 $ (2,655) (17.4)% Operating expenses 12,732 15,555 (2,823) (18.1)% Operating loss (146) (314) (168) (53.5)% Nonoperating income (expense) (293) (381) (88) (23.1)% Income tax benefit 157 109 48 44.0 % Net loss $ (282) $ (586) $ (304) (51.9)% Each of these items is discussed in the following sections. Operating Revenue. The table below shows components of operating revenue for the year ended December 31, 2009 and period to period comparisons for operating revenue, passenger revenue per available seat mile (RASM) and available seat miles (ASMs) by geographic region for our mainline and regional operations: Revenue % Increase (Decrease) in 2009 vs 2008 (in millions) Revenue RASM ASMs Passenger revenue: Domestic $ 4,581 (18.7)% (12.6)% (6.9)% Trans Atlantic 2,249 (24.6)% (17.2)% (8.9)% Latin America 1,483 (15.3)% (16.0)% 0.9 % Pacific 931 (8.4)% (15.4)% 8.5 % Total Mainline 9,244 (18.8)% (14.5)% (5.0)% Regional 1,894 (19.6)% (14.0)% (6.4)% Total 11,138 (18.9)% (14.5)% (5.2)% Cargo 366 (26.4)% Other 1,082 7.4 % Operating revenue $12,586 (17.4)% Passenger revenue decreased significantly in 2009 as compared to 2008 due to reduced traffic, less capacity and lower RASM. The reduced traffic and lower RASM reflects lower fares and less high yield business traffic attributable to the global recession. The decline in demand has disproportionately reduced the volume of high yield traffic, as many business travelers are either curtailing their travel or purchasing lower yield economy tickets. Cargo revenue decreased due to lower fuel surcharge rates and decreased freight volume. Other revenue increased due to the implementation of new fees for checking bags in 2008 and a change in how certain costs are handled under our capacity purchase agreement with ExpressJet, offset in part by a reduction in sublease income received from ExpressJet and decreased revenue associated with sales of mileage credits in our OnePass frequent flyer program and ticket change fees. Operating Expenses. The table below shows period to period comparisons by type of operating expense for our consolidated operations for the year ended December 31 (in millions, except percentage changes): 2009 2008 Increase (Decrease) % Increase (Decrease) Aircraft fuel and related taxes $3,317 $ 5,919 $(2,602) (44.0)% Wages, salaries and related costs 3,137 2,957 180 6.1 % Aircraft rentals 934 976 (42) (4.3)% Regional capacity purchase, net 848 1,059 (211) (19.9)% Landing fees and other rentals 841 853 (12) (1.4)% Distribution costs 624 717 (93) (13.0)% Maintenance, materials and repairs 617 612 5 0.8 % Depreciation and amortization 494 438 56 12.8 % Passenger services 373 406 (33) (8.1)% Special charges 145 181 (36) NM Other 1,402 1,437 (35) (2.4)% $12,732 $15,555 $(2,823) (18.1)% NM Not meaningful Operating expenses decreased 18.1% primarily due to the following: Aircraft fuel and related taxes decreased due to a 39.8% decrease in consolidated jet fuel prices and decreased flying. Our average jet fuel price per gallon including related taxes decreased to $1.97 in 2009 from $3.27 in 2008. Our average jet fuel price includes losses related to our fuel hedging program of $0.23 per gallon in 2009 compared to losses of $0.10 per gallon in 2008. Wages, salaries and related costs increased primarily due to $155 million of higher pension expense resulting primarily from lower returns on plan assets in 2008. Higher wage rates and health insurance costs were offset by a 5% reduction in the number of full time equivalent employees. Aircraft rentals decreased due to the retirement of leased Boeing 737 aircraft in 2008 and 2009. New aircraft delivered in 2008 and 2009 were purchased, with the related expense being reported in depreciation and amortization and interest expense. Regional capacity purchase, net, includes expenses related to our capacity purchase agreements. Our most significant capacity purchase agreement is with ExpressJet. We also have agreements with Chautauqua, Colgan and CommutAir. The net amounts consisted of the following for the year ended December 31 (in millions, except percentage changes): Increase % Increase 2009 2008 (Decrease) (Decrease) Capacity purchase expenses $848 $1,181 $(333) (28.2)% Aircraft sublease income (122) (122) (100.0)% Regional capacity purchase, net $848 $1,059 $(211) (19.9)% Capacity purchase expenses decreased due to rate reductions in conjunction with our amended capacity purchase agreement with ExpressJet effective July 1, 2008 and capacity reductions. There was no aircraft sublease income in 2009 because ExpressJet no longer pays sublease rent for aircraft operated on our behalf. Sublease income on aircraft that were subleased to other operators, but not operated on our behalf, of $23 million and $76 million for 2009 and 2008, respectively, is recorded as other revenue. Distribution costs decreased due to lower credit card discount fees, booking fees and travel agency commissions, all of which resulted from decreased passenger revenue. Depreciation and amortization expense increased in 2009 due to higher capitalizable project costs, acceleration of depreciation on exiting aircraft and increased depreciation from new aircraft. Passenger services expenses decreased due to fewer meals and beverages in 2009 compared to 2008, resulting from the decreased demand for air travel in the weak economy, and lower mishandled baggage expenses. Special charges. See Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8 of this report for a discussion of the special charges. Other operating expenses decreased due to insurance settlements received in 2009 related to Hurricane Ike, reduced technology expenses resulting from new contracts, lower expense due to station closings, the impact on certain expenses of more favorable foreign currency exchange rates, lower OnePass reward expenses and lower ground handling, security and outside services costs as a result of capacity reductions, partially offset by increases in expenses resulting from changes in who is contractually responsible for certain costs under our capacity purchase agreement with ExpressJet. Nonoperating Income (Expense). Nonoperating expense decreased $88 million in 2009 compared 2008 due to the following: Net interest expense increased $44 million primarily as a result of lower interest income. Gain on sale of investments in 2008 consisted of $78 million related to the sale of our remaining interests in Copa. Other than temporary impairment losses on investments included a loss of $60 million in 2008 to reflect the decline in the value of our student loan related auction rate securities. Other nonoperating income (expense) included fuel hedge ineffectiveness gains of $7 million and $26 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively. The ineffectiveness was caused by our non jet fuel derivatives experiencing a higher relative increase in value than the jet fuel being hedged. Other nonoperating income (expense) in 2009 also included foreign exchange gains of $8 million, compared to losses of $37 million in 2008, and an increase in the fair value of the cash surrender value of company owned life insurance policies. Additionally, other nonoperating income (expense) in 2008 included $125 million expense related to changes in the fair value of fuel derivative contracts with Lehman Brothers that were deemed ineffective after Lehman Brothers declared bankruptcy and a gain of $26 million related to our receipt of a put right covering certain of the student loan related auction rate securities. Income Taxes. We are required to consider all items (including items recorded in other comprehensive income) in determining the amount of tax benefit that results from a loss from continuing operations and that should be allocated to continuing operations. As a result, we recorded a $158 million non cash tax benefit on the loss from continuing operations for 2009, which is exactly offset by income tax expense on other comprehensive income. However, while the income tax benefit from continuing operations is reported in our consolidated statement of operations, the income tax expense on other comprehensive income is recorded directly to other comprehensive income, which is a component of stockholders equity. Because the income tax expense on other comprehensive income is equal to the income tax benefit from continuing operations, our net deferred tax position at December 31, 2009 is not impacted by this tax allocation. Excluding this special item, our effective tax rates differ from the federal statutory rate of 35% primarily due to the following: changes in the valuation allowance, expenses that are not deductible for federal income tax purposes and state income taxes. We are required to provide a valuation allowance for our deferred tax assets in excess of deferred tax liabilities because we have concluded that it is more likely than not that such deferred tax assets ultimately will not be realized. Segment Results of Operations We have two reportable segments: mainline and regional. The mainline segment consists of flights to cities using larger jets while the regional segment currently consists of flights with a capacity of 79 or fewer seats. As of December 31, 2009, the regional segment was operated by ExpressJet, Chautauqua, CommutAir and Colgan through capacity purchase agreements. Under these agreements, we purchase all of the capacity related to aircraft covered by the contracts and are responsible for setting prices and selling all of the related seat inventory. In exchange for the regional carriers operation of the flights, we pay the regional carriers for each scheduled block hour based on agreed formulas. Under the agreements, we recognize all passenger, cargo and other revenue associated with each flight, and are responsible for most revenue related expenses, including commissions, reservations and catering. We evaluate segment performance based on several factors, of which the primary financial measure is operating income (loss). However, we do not manage our business or allocate resources based on segment operating profit or loss because (1) our flight schedules are designed to maximize revenue from passengers flying, (2) many operations of the two segments are substantially integrated (for example, airport operations, sales and marketing, scheduling and ticketing), and (3) management decisions are based on their anticipated impact on the overall network, not on one individual segment. Mainline Results of Operations. Significant components of our mainline segments operating results for the year ended December 31 were as follows (in millions, except percentage changes): 2009 2008 Increase (Decrease) % Increase (Decrease) Operating revenue $10,635 $12,827 $(2,192) (17.1)% Operating expenses: Aircraft fuel and related taxes 2,755 4,905 (2,150) (43.8)% Wages, salaries and related costs 2,968 2,850 118 4.1 % Aircraft rentals 621 662 (41) (6.2)% Landing fees and other rentals 741 782 (41) (5.2)% Distribution costs 534 611 (77) (12.6)% Maintenance, materials and repairs 617 612 5 0.8 % Depreciation and amortization 481 427 54 12.6 % Passenger services 349 384 (35) (9.1)% Special charges 125 155 (30) NM Other 1,280 1,365 (85) (6.2)% 10,471 12,753 (2,282) (17.9)% Operating income $ 164 $ 74 $ 90 121.6 % The variances in specific line items for the mainline segment were due to the same factors discussed under consolidated results of operations. Regional Results of Operations. Significant components of our regional segments operating results for the year ended December 31 were as follows (in millions, except percentage changes): Increase % Increase 2009 2008 (Decrease) (Decrease) Operating revenue $1,951 $2,414 $(463) (19.2)% Operating expenses: Aircraft fuel and related taxes 562 1,014 (452) (44.6)% Wages, salaries and related costs 169 107 62 57.9 % Aircraft rentals 313 314 (1) (0.3)% Regional capacity purchase, net 848 1,059 (211) (19.9)% Landing fees and other rentals 100 71 29 40.8 % Distribution costs 90 106 (16) (15.1)% Depreciation and amortization 13 11 2 18.2 % Passenger services 24 22 2 9.1 % Special charges 20 26 (6) NM Other 122 72 50 69.4 % 2,261 2,802 (541) (19.3)% Operating loss $ (310) $(388) $ (78) (20.1)% The reported results of our regional segment do not reflect the total contribution of the regional segment to our system wide operations. The regional segment generates revenue for the mainline segment as it feeds passengers from smaller cities into our hubs. The variances in specific line items for the regional segment reflect generally the same factors discussed under consolidated results of operations, with the exception of wages, salaries and related costs, landing fees and other rentals, passenger services and other operating expenses. These expenses increased for the regional segment due to changes in who is contractually responsible for certain costs under our capacity purchase agreement with ExpressJet and the transition of management of certain airports to us from ExpressJet. Comparison of Year Ended December 31, 2008 to December 31, 2007 Consolidated Results of Operations Significant components of our consolidated operating results for the year ended December 31 were as follows (in millions, except percentage changes): Increase % Increase 2008 2007 (Decrease) (Decrease) Operating revenue $15,241 $14,232 $ 1,009 7.1% Operating expenses 15,555 13,545 2,010 14.8% Operating income (loss) (314) 687 (1,001) NM Nonoperating income (expense) (381) (131) 250 NM Income tax benefit (expense) 109 (117) 226 NM Net income (loss) $ (586) $ 439 $(1,025) NM Each of these items is discussed in the following sections. Operating Revenue. The table below shows components of operating revenue for the year ended December 31, 2008 and period to period comparisons for operating revenue, RASM and ASMs by geographic region for our mainline and regional operations: Revenue % Increase (Decrease) in 2008 vs 2007 (in millions) Revenue RASM ASMs Passenger revenue: Domestic $ 5,633 1.2 % 6.4 % (4.9)% Trans Atlantic 2,983 11.6 % 2.5 % 8.9 % Latin America 1,750 12.1 % 9.4 % 2.5 % Pacific 1,016 2.3 % 8.5 % (5.6)% Total Mainline 11,382 5.4 % 6.0 % (0.6)% Regional 2,355 7.0 % 3.8 % 3.1 % Total 13,737 5.7 % 5.9 % (0.2)% Cargo 497 9.7 % Other 1,007 28.4 % Operating revenue $15,241 7.1 % Passenger revenue increased due to increased international traffic on increased capacity and increased fares. The improved RASM reflects our actions taken to increase fares and implement more restrictions on low fare tickets, as well as our domestic capacity reductions commenced in September 2008. Cargo revenue increased due to higher fuel surcharge rates and increased mail volume. Other revenue increased due to higher revenue associated with sales of mileage credits on our OnePass frequent flyer program, higher ticket change fees, the implementation of new fees for checking bags and changes in how certain costs are handled under the ExpressJet CPA. Operating Expenses. The table below shows period to period comparisons by type of operating expense for our consolidated operations for the year ended December 31 (in millions, except percentage changes): 2008 2007 Increase (Decrease) % Increase (Decrease) Aircraft fuel and related taxes $ 5,919 $ 4,034 $1,885 46.7 % Wages, salaries and related costs 2,957 3,127 (170) (5.4)% Aircraft rentals 976 994 (18) (1.8)% Regional capacity purchase, net 1,059 1,113 (54) (4.9)% Landing fees and other rentals 853 790 63 8.0 % Distribution costs 717 682 35 5.1 % Maintenance, materials and repairs 612 621 (9) (1.4)% Depreciation and amortization 438 413 25 6.1 % Passenger services 406 389 17 4.4 % Special charges 181 13 168 NM Other 1,437 1,369 68 5.0 % $15,555 $13,545 $2,010 14.8 % Operating expenses increased 14.8% primarily due to the following: Aircraft fuel and related taxes increased due to a 50.0% increase in jet fuel prices. Our average jet fuel price per gallon including related taxes increased to $3.27 in 2008 from $2.18 in 2007. Our average jet fuel price includes losses related to our fuel hedging program of $0.10 per gallon in 2008, compared to gains of $0.02 per gallon in 2007. Wages, salaries and related costs decreased primarily due to a $172 million decrease in profit sharing expenses. Although the average number of full time equivalent employees decreased approximately 1% in 2008, the impact on expenses was offset by wage increases. Aircraft rentals decreased due to the retirement of several Boeing 737 aircraft. New aircraft delivered in 2008 were all purchased, with the related expense being reflected in depreciation and amortization. Regional capacity purchase, net includes expenses related to our capacity purchase agreements. Our most significant capacity purchase agreement is with ExpressJet. Regional capacity purchase, net is net of our rental income on aircraft leased to ExpressJet and flown for us in 2007 and the first six months of 2008. Under the ExpressJet CPA, ExpressJet no longer pays sublease rent for aircraft operated on our behalf. The net amounts consisted of the following for the year ended December 31 (in millions, except percentage changes): Increase % Increase 2008 2007 (Decrease) (Decrease) Capacity purchase expenses $1,181 $1,379 $(198) (14.4)% Aircraft sublease income (122) (266) (144) (54.1)% Regional capacity purchase, net $1,059 $1,113 $ (54) (4.9)% Regional capacity purchase, net did not change significantly compared to 2007. Sublease income on aircraft that were subleased to other operators, but not operated on our behalf, of $76 million and $79 million for 2008 and 2007, respectively, is recorded as other revenue. Landing fees and other rentals increased primarily due to a higher number of international flights and rate increases. Distribution costs, which consist primarily of reservation booking fees, credit card fees and commissions, increased due to a 5.7% increase in passenger revenue. Other operating expenses increased primarily due to a greater number of international flights, which resulted in increased air navigation fees and ground handling, security and related expenses, changes in who is contractually responsible for certain costs under the ExpressJet CPA and higher OnePass reward expenses. Special charges. See Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8 of this report for a discussion of the special charges. Nonoperating Income (Expense). Nonoperating income (expense) includes net interest expense (interest expense less interest income and capitalized interest), gains from dispositions of investments and any ineffectiveness of our derivative financial instruments. Total nonoperating expense increased $250 million in 2008 compared to 2007 due to the following: Net interest expense increased $72 million primarily due to lower interest income resulting from lower interest rates on investments and lower cash, cash equivalents and short term investments balances. Gain on sale of investments of $78 million in 2008 related to the sale of our remaining interests in Copa. Gain on sale of investments in 2007 consisted of $30 million related to the sale of our interest in ARINC, Inc. (ARINC) and $7 million related to the sale of our remaining interest in Holdings. Other than temporary impairment losses on investments included a loss of $60 million in 2008 to reflect the decline in the value of our student loan related auction rate securities. Other nonoperating income (expense) included $125 million expense related to changes in the fair value of fuel derivative contracts with Lehman Brothers that were deemed ineffective after Lehman Brothers declared bankruptcy in 2008. This account also includes other fuel hedge ineffectiveness gains of $26 million and $14 million in 2008 and 2007, respectively, caused by our non jet fuel derivatives experiencing a higher relative change in value than the jet fuel being hedged. Other nonoperating income expense in 2008 also includes a gain of $26 million related to our receipt of a put right covering certain of the student loan related auction rate securities. Other variances in other nonoperating income (expense) include $37 million of foreign currency exchange losses in 2008 compared to gains of $2 million in 2007, a $16 million increase in the fair value of the cash surrender value of company owned life insurance policies in 2008 compared to a $3 million increase in 2007 and $6 million less equity in earnings of other companies in 2008 compared to 2007 resulting from our decreased ownership of Copa and Holdings. Income Taxes. In the fourth quarter of 2007, we recorded income tax expense of $114 million to increase the valuation allowance to be fully reserved for certain NOLs, expiring in 2008 through 2011, which more likely than not would not be realized prior to their expiration. In the second quarter of 2008, we recorded an income tax benefit of $28 million resulting from higher utilization of those NOLs than had been previously anticipated. Segment Results of Operations Mainline Results of Operations. Significant components of our mainline segments operating results for the year ended December 31 were as follows (in millions, except percentage changes): 2008 2007 Increase (Decrease) % Increase (Decrease) Operating revenue $12,827 $12,019 $ 808 6.7 % Operating expenses: Aircraft fuel and related taxes 4,905 3,354 1,551 46.2 % Wages, salaries and related costs 2,850 3,073 (223) (7.3)% Aircraft rentals 662 680 (18) (2.6)% Landing fees and other rentals 782 738 44 6.0 % Distribution costs 611 583 28 4.8 % Maintenance, materials and repairs 612 621 (9) (1.4)% Depreciation and amortization 427 400 27 6.8 % Passenger services 384 374 10 2.7 % Special charges 155 13 142 NM Other 1,365 1,335 30 2.2 % 12,753 11,171 1,582 14.2 % Operating income $ 74 $ 848 $(774) (91.3)% The variances in specific line items for the mainline segment were due to the same factors discussed under consolidated results of operations. Regional Results of Operations. Significant components of our regional segments operating results for the year ended December 31 were as follows (in millions, except percentage changes): Increase % Increase 2008 2007 (Decrease) (Decrease) Operating revenue $2,414 $2,213 $ 201 9.1 % Operating expenses: Aircraft fuel and related taxes 1,014 680 334 49.1 % Wages, salaries and related costs 107 54 53 98.1 % Aircraft rentals 314 314 Regional capacity purchase, net 1,059 1,113 (54) (4.9)% Landing fees and other rentals 71 52 19 36.5 % Distribution costs 106 99 7 7.1 % Depreciation and amortization 11 13 (2) (15.4)% Passenger services 22 15 7 46.7 % Special charges 26 26 NM Other 72 34 38 NM 2,802 2,374 428 18.0 % Operating loss $(388) $(161) $(227) NM The reported results of our regional segment do not reflect the total contribution of the regional segment to our system wide operations. The regional segment generates revenue for the mainline segment as it provides flow traffic to our hubs. The variances in material line items for the regional segment reflect generally the same factors discussed under consolidated results of operations and changes in who is contractually responsible for certain costs under the ExpressJet CPA. Liquidity and Capital Resources As of December 31, 2009, we had $2.9 billion in unrestricted cash, cash equivalents and short term investments, which is $213 million higher than at December 31, 2008. At December 31, 2009, we also had $164 million of restricted cash, cash equivalents and short term investments, which is primarily collateral for estimated future workers compensation claims, credit card processing contracts, letters of credit and performance bonds. Restricted cash, cash equivalents and short term investments at December 31, 2008 totaled $190 million. The decrease in restricted cash is primarily the result of the substitution of cash collateral for student loan related auction rate securities previously posted as collateral under our workers compensation program. The use of cash as collateral lowered the amount required to be posted. As is the case with many of our principal competitors, we have a high proportion of debt compared to our capital. We have a significant amount of fixed obligations, including debt, aircraft leases and financings, leases of airport property and other facilities and pension funding obligations. At December 31, 2009, we had approximately $6.3 billion of debt and capital lease obligations, including $2.1 billion that will come due by the end of 2011 (consisting of $1.0 billion during 2010 and $1.1 billion during 2011). In addition, we have substantial non cancelable commitments for capital expenditures, including the acquisition of new aircraft and related spare engines. We do not currently have any undrawn lines of credit or revolving credit facilities and most of our otherwise readily financeable assets are encumbered. The global economic recession severely disrupted the global capital markets, resulting in a diminished availability of financing and higher cost for financing that was obtainable. Although access to the capital markets has improved over the past several months, as evidenced by our recent financing transactions, we cannot give any assurances that we will be able to obtain additional financing or otherwise access the capital markets in the future on acceptable terms (or at all). We must achieve and sustain profitability and or access the capital markets to meet our significant long term debt and capital lease obligations and future commitments for capital expenditures, including the acquisition of aircraft and related spare engines. Sources and Uses of Cash Operating Activities. Net cash flows provided by operations for the year ended December 31, 2009 were $362 million, an improvement of $686 million from the $324 million in net cash used by operating activities in 2008. The increase in cash flows provided by operations in 2009 compared to 2008 is primarily the result of an improvement in operating results. Our operating loss was $168 million lower in 2009 than in 2008. Also, operating cash flows in 2008 were negatively impacted by our posting $171 million of cash collateral related to our fuel hedges, which were in a net liability position at December 31, 2008. Investing Activities. Cash flows used in investing activities for the year ended December 31 were as follows (in millions): Cash Increase 2009 2008 (Decrease) Capital expenditures $(381) $(373) $ (8) Aircraft purchase deposits refunded (paid), net 29 102 (73) (Purchase) sale of short term investments, net 180 115 65 Proceeds from sales of investments, net 30 171 (141) Expenditures for airport operating rights (22) (131) 109 Proceeds from sales of property and equipment 64 113 (49) Decrease (increase) in restricted cash, cash equivalents and short term investments 26 (13) 39 Other cash flows from investing activities (4) (4) Net cash used in investing activities $ (78) $ (16) $ (62) Capital expenditures for 2009 consisted of $264 million of fleet expenditures and $117 million of non fleet expenditures. Fleet expenditures in 2009 included the portion of the aircraft purchase price in excess of financings, the installation of winglets, the installation of Audio Video on Demand entertainment systems and flat bed BusinessFirst seats for certain Boeing 777 and 757 aircraft and flight simulators and training equipment. The 2009 non fleet expenditures were primarily for Star Alliance related costs, ground service equipment and technology and terminal enhancements. We have substantial commitments for capital expenditures, including for the acquisition of new aircraft. As of December 31, 2009, we had firm commitments to purchase 84 new Boeing aircraft scheduled for delivery from 2010 through 2016, with an estimated aggregate cost of $5.1 billion including related spare engines. In addition to our firm order aircraft, we had options to purchase a total of 98 additional Boeing aircraft as of December 31, 2009. Projected net capital expenditures for 2010 are as follows (in millions): Fleet related (excluding aircraft to be acquired through the issuance of debt) $265 Non fleet 140 Net capital expenditures $405 Aircraft purchase deposits 25 Projected net capital expenditures $430 Projected fleet expenditures include the portion of the aircraft purchase price in excess of financings, flight simulators and training equipment related to Boeing 787 aircraft, aircraft reconfigurations and other product enhancements including winglet installations, Audio Video on Demand systems, flat bed BusinessFirst seats and in seat power installations. Projected non fleet capital expenditures are primarily for Star Alliance related costs and technology and terminal enhancements. While some of our projected capital expenditures are related to projects we have committed to, a significant number of projects can be deferred. Should economic conditions warrant, we will reduce our capital expenditures, and expect to be able to do so without materially impacting our operations. Net purchase deposits refunded were lower in 2009 as the result of fewer aircraft deliveries in 2009 than in 2008. Proceeds from sales of short term investments were higher in 2009 than in 2008 due to the conversion of short term investments to cash and cash equivalents. We sold eight Boeing 737 500 aircraft to foreign buyers during 2009 and received cash proceeds of $53 million, in addition to deposits received in 2008. We sold one grounded Boeing 737 500 aircraft to a foreign buyer in February 2010 and we have agreements to sell the three remaining grounded Boeing 737 500 aircraft to foreign buyers. These sales are subject to customary closing conditions, some of which are outside of our control, and we cannot give any assurances that the buyers of these aircraft will be able to obtain financing for these transactions, that there will not be delays in deliveries or that the closing of these transactions will occur. We hold cash deposits that secure the buyers obligations under the aircraft sale contracts, and we are entitled to damages under the aircraft sale contract if the buyers do not take delivery of the aircraft when required. Expenditures for airport operating rights relate to our acquisition of slots at Londons Heathrow Airport. Financing Activities. Cash flows provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31 were as follows (in millions): Cash Increase 2009 2008 (Decrease) Payments on long term debt and capital lease obligations $(610) $(641) $ 31 Proceeds from issuance of long term debt, net 538 642 (104) Proceeds from public offering of common stock, net 158 358 (200) Proceeds from issuance of common stock pursuant to stock plans 11 18 (7) Net cash provided by financing activities $ 97 $ 377 $(280) Debt Secured by Aircraft. In April 2007, we obtained financing for 12 Boeing 737 800s and 18 Boeing 737 900ERs. We applied this financing to 30 Boeing aircraft delivered to us in 2008 and 2009 and recorded related debt of $1.1 billion, including $121 million recorded in 2009 and $1.0 billion recorded in 2008. On July 1, 2009, we obtained financing for 12 currently owned Boeing aircraft and five new Boeing 737 900ER aircraft. An enhanced equipment trust raised $390 million through the issuance of a single class of enhanced equipment trust certificates bearing interest at 9%. During 2009, we issued equipment notes with respect to the 12 currently owned aircraft, resulting in proceeds of $249 million cash for our general corporate purposes, and equipment notes with respect to five new Boeing 737 900ER aircraft, resulting in proceeds of $141 million to finance the purchase of the aircraft. Principal payments on the equipment notes and the corresponding distribution of these payments to certificate holders are scheduled from January 2010 through July 2016. In November 2009, we obtained financing for eight currently owned Boeing aircraft, nine new Boeing 737 800 aircraft and two new Boeing 777 aircraft. These aircraft are expected to be refinanced or delivered by August 31, 2010. In connection with this financing, enhanced equipment trusts raised $644 million through the issuance of two classes of enhanced equipment trust certificates. Class A certificates, with an aggregate principal amount of $528 million, bear interest at 7.25% and Class B certificates, with an aggregate principal amount of $117 million, bear interest at 9.25%. The proceeds from the sale of the certificates are initially being held by a depositary in escrow for the benefit of the certificate holders until we issue equipment notes to the trust, which will purchase such notes with a portion of the escrowed funds. These escrowed funds are not guaranteed by us and are not reported as debt on our consolidated balance sheet because the proceeds held by the depositary are not our assets. Any unused proceeds will be distributed directly to the certificate holders. Principal payments on the equipment notes and the corresponding distribution of these payments to certificate holders will begin in November 2010 and will end in November 2019 for Class A certificates and in May 2017 for Class B certificates. During 2009, we entered into loan agreements under which we borrowed $180 million. This indebtedness is secured by five new Boeing 737 900ER aircraft and two Boeing 737 800 aircraft that this debt refinanced. During 2008, we obtained $268 million through three separate financings secured by two new Boeing 737 900ER aircraft, seven Boeing 757 200 aircraft and five Boeing 737 700 aircraft. We have backstop financing available for the three other Boeing 737 aircraft scheduled for delivery in 2010, subject to customary closing conditions. However, we do not have backstop financing or any other financing currently in place for the balance of the Boeing aircraft on order. Further financing will be needed to satisfy our capital commitments for our firm order aircraft and other related capital expenditures. We can provide no assurance that the backstop financing or any other financing not already in place for our aircraft deliveries will be available to us when needed on acceptable terms or at all. Since the commitments for firm order aircraft are non cancelable, and assuming no breach of the agreement by Boeing, if we are unable to obtain financing and cannot otherwise satisfy our commitment to purchase these aircraft, the manufacturer could exercise its rights and remedies under applicable law, such as seeking to terminate the contract for a material breach, selling the aircraft to one or more other parties and suing us for damages to recover any resulting losses incurred by the manufacturer. Other Financing Activities. In December 2009, we issued $230 million in principal amount of 4.5% convertible notes and received proceeds of $224 million. The notes mature on January 15, 2015 and are convertible into our Class B common stock at an initial conversion price of approximately $19.87 per share. We do not have the option to pay the conversion price in cash; however, holders of the notes may require us to repurchase all or a portion of their notes for cash at par plus any accrued and unpaid interest if certain changes in control of Continental occur. The conversion price may also be adjusted within a specified range in certain circumstances if a change in control of Continental occurs. On December 30, 2009, we entered into an amendment of our Debit Card Marketing Agreement with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (JP Morgan Chase) under which JP Morgan Chase purchases frequent flyer mileage credits to be earned by One Pass members for making purchases using a Continental branded debit card issued by JP Morgan Chase. The agreement provides for a payment to us of $40 million in early 2010 for the advance purchase of frequent flyer mileage credits beginning January 1, 2016, or earlier in certain circumstances. The purchase of mileage credits has been treated as a loan from JP Morgan Chase with an implicit interest rate of 5.5% and is reported as long term debt in our consolidated balance sheet. On June 10, 2008, we entered into an amendment and restatement of our Bankcard Agreement with Chase, under which Chase purchases frequent flyer mileage credits to be earned by OnePass members for making purchases using a Continental branded credit card issued by Chase. The Bankcard Agreement provides for a payment to us of $413 million, of which $235 million relates to the advance purchase of frequent flyer mileage credits for the year 2016 and the balance of which is in consideration for certain other commitments with respect to the co branding relationship, including the extension of the term of the Bankcard Agreement until December 31, 2016. In connection with the advance purchase of mileage credits, we have provided a security interest to Chase in certain routes and slots, including certain slots at Londons Heathrow Airport. The $235 million purchase of mileage credits has been treated as a loan from Chase with an implicit interest rate of 6.18% and is reported as long term debt in our consolidated balance sheet. Our liability will be reduced ratably in 2016 as the mileage credits are issued to Chase. In August 2009, we completed a public offering of 14 million shares of our common stock at a price to the public of $11.20 per share, raising net proceeds of $158 million for general corporate purposes. We received net proceeds of $358 million in 2008 from public offerings totaling 24 million shares of our common stock. Liquidity and Credit Support Providers. We have utilized proceeds from the issuance of enhanced equipment trust certificates to finance the acquisition of 246 leased and owned mainline jet aircraft, certain spare engines and certain spare parts. Typically, these enhanced equipment trust certificates contain liquidity facilities whereby a third party agrees to make payments sufficient to pay at least 18 months of interest on the applicable certificates if a payment default occurs. The liquidity providers for these certificates include the following: Credit Agricole S.A., Landesbank Hessen Thuringen Girozentrale, Morgan Stanley Capital Services, Morgan Stanley Bank, Westdeutsche Landesbank Girozentrale, AIG Matched Funding Corp., ABN AMRO Bank N.V., Credit Suisse, Caisse des Depots et Consignations, Bayerische Landesbank Girozentrale, ING Bank N.V., De Nationale Investeringsbank N.V., Natixis S.A. and RZB Finance LLC. We are also the issuer of enhanced equipment trust certificates secured by 135 leased regional jet aircraft currently operated by ExpressJet. The liquidity providers for these certificates include the following: ABN AMRO Bank N.V., Chicago Branch, Citibank N.A., Citicorp North America, Inc., Landesbank Baden Wurttemberg, RZB Finance LLC and WestLB AG, New York Branch. We currently utilize policy providers to provide credit support on three separate financings with an outstanding principal balance of $452 million at December 31, 2009. The policy providers have unconditionally guaranteed the payment of interest on the notes when due and the payment of principal on the notes no later than 24 months after the final scheduled payment date. Policy providers on these notes are Ambac Assurance Corporation (a subsidiary of Ambac Financial Group, Inc.) and Financial Guaranty Insurance Company (a subsidiary of FGIC). Financial information for the parent company of Ambac Assurance Corporation is available over the internet at the SECs website at www.sec.gov or at the SECs public reference room in Washington, D.C. and financial information for FGIC is available over the internet at www.fgic.com. A policy provider is also used as credit support for the financing of certain facilities at Houston Bush, currently subject to a sublease by us to the City of Houston, with an outstanding balance of $42 million at December 31, 2009. Contractual Obligations. The following table summarizes the effect that minimum debt, lease and other material noncancelable commitments listed below are expected to have on our future cash flows (in millions): Contractual Obligations Payments Due Later Years Total 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 Long term debt (1) $ 7,632 $1,254 $ 1,380 $ 767 $ 811 $ 474 $2,946 Capital lease obligations (1) 466 17 16 16 16 16 385 Aircraft operating leases (2) 8,145 994 977 948 933 904 3,389 Nonaircraft operating leases (3) 5,830 462 426 513 376 359 3,694 Capacity purchase agreements (4) 4,306 693 693 704 683 649 884 Aircraft and other purchase commitments (5) 5,393 712 855 646 723 903 1,554 Projected pension contributions (6) 1,393 119 132 179 161 160 642 Total (7) $33,165 $4,251 $4,479 $3,773 $3,703 $3,465 $13,494 (1) Represents contractual amounts due, including interest. Interest on floating rate debt was estimated using rates in effect at December 31, 2009. (2) Represents contractual amounts due and excludes $139 million of projected sublease income to be received on aircraft that are subleased to other operators, but not operated on our behalf. (3) Represents minimum contractual amounts. (4) Represents our estimates of future minimum noncancelable commitments under our capacity purchase agreements and does not include the portion of the underlying obligations for aircraft leased to ExpressJet or deemed to be leased from Chautauqua, CommutAir or Colgan and facility rent that is disclosed as part of aircraft and nonaircraft operating leases. See Note 16 to our consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8 of this report for the significant assumptions used to estimate the payments. (5) Represents contractual commitments for firm order aircraft and spare engines only, net of previously paid purchase deposits, and noncancelable commitments to purchase goods and services, primarily information technology support. See Note 19 to our consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8 of this report for a discussion of our purchase commitments. (6) Represents our estimate of the minimum funding requirements as determined by government regulations. Amounts are subject to change based on numerous assumptions, including the performance of the assets in the plan and bond rates. See Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates in this Item for a discussion of our assumptions regarding our pension plans. (7) Total contractual obligations do not include long term contracts where the commitment is variable in nature, such as credit card processing agreements and cost per hour engine maintenance agreements, or where short term cancellation provisions exist. We expect to fund our future capital and purchase commitments through internally generated funds, general company financings and aircraft financing transactions. However, especially if there are any further disruptions in the global capital markets as experienced in late 2008 and into 2009, there can be no assurance that sufficient financing will be available for all aircraft and other capital expenditures or that, if necessary, we will be able to defer or otherwise renegotiate our capital commitments.

We have no arrangements of the types described in the first three categories that we believe may have a material current or future effect on our results of operations. Certain guarantees that we do not expect to have a material current or future effect on our results of operations, financial condition or liquidity are disclosed in Note 19 to our consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8 of this report. We do have obligations arising out of variable interests in unconsolidated entities. See Note 15 to our consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8 of this report for a discussion of our off balance sheet aircraft leases, airport leases (which include the US Airways contingent liability), subsidiary trust and our capacity purchase agreement with ExpressJet. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Critical accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties, and potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions. We believe that our critical accounting policies are limited to those described below. For a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies, see Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8 of this report. Pension Plans. We account for our defined benefit pension plans in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Subtopic 715 30, Defined Benefit Plans Pension. Under this guidance, pension expense is recognized on an accrual basis over employees approximate service periods. We recognized expense for our defined benefit pension plans totaling $279 million, $147 million and $191 million in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively, including settlement charges. We currently expect our expense related to our defined benefit pension plans to be approximately $215 million in 2010. Our plans under funded status was $1.3 billion at December 31, 2009 and $1.4 billion at December 31, 2008. Funding requirements for tax qualified defined benefit pension plans are determined by government regulations. During 2009, we contributed $176 million to our tax qualified defined benefit pension plans, satisfying our minimum funding requirements during calendar year 2009. We contributed an additional $34 million to our tax qualified defined benefit pension plans in January 2010. We estimate that our remaining minimum funding requirements during calendar year 2010 are approximately $85 million. The fair value of our plans assets increased from $1.1 billion at December 31, 2008 to $1.4 billion at December 31, 2009. When calculating pension expense for 2009, we assumed that our plans assets would generate a long term rate of return of 8.25%. We assumed a long term rate of return for calculating pension expense in 2008 and 2007 of 8.5% and 8.26%, respectively. We develop our expected long term rate of return assumption based on historical experience and by evaluating input from the trustee managing the plans assets. Our expected long term rate of return on plan assets is based on a target allocation of assets, which is based on our goal of earning the highest rate of return while maintaining risk at acceptable levels. Our projected long term rate of return is slightly higher than some market indices due to the active management of our plans assets, and is supported by the historical returns on our plans assets. The plans strive to have assets sufficiently diversified so that adverse or unexpected results from one security class will not have an unduly detrimental impact on the entire portfolio. We regularly review our actual asset allocation and the pension plans investments are periodically rebalanced to our targeted allocation when considered appropriate. The defined benefit pension plans assets consist primarily of equity and fixed income securities held through common collective trusts. Equity securities include investments in large cap and small cap companies. Fixed income securities include corporate bonds of companies in diversified industries and asset and mortgage backed securities. Investments in equity securities and fixed income securities are commingled funds valued at the unit of participation value of shares held by the plans trust. The private equity funds invest primarily in common stock of companies in diversified industries and in buyout, venture capital and special situation funds. Investments in private equity funds are valued at the net asset value of shares held by the plans trust at year end. Our allocation of assets was as follows at December 31, 2009: Percent of Total Expected Long Term Rate of Return Equity securities: U.S. companies 48% 8% International companies 21 9 Fixed income securities 21 5 Private equity funds 10 11 Pension expense increases as the expected rate of return on plan assets decreases. When calculating pension expense for 2010, we will assume that our plans assets will generate a weighted average long term rate of return of 8.0%. The decrease of 25 basis points from the rate used to determine 2009 expense reflects lower expected returns on investments due to the global recession. Lowering the expected long term rate of return on our plan assets by an additional 50 basis points (from 8.0% to 7.5%) would increase our estimated 2010 pension expense by approximately $7 million. We discounted our future pension obligations using a weighted average rate of 6.01% at December 31, 2009, compared to 6.13% at December 31, 2008. We determine the appropriate discount rate for each of our plans based on current rates on high quality corporate bonds that would generate the cash flow necessary to pay plan benefits when due. This approach can result in different discount rates for different plans, depending on each plans projected benefit payments. The pension liability and future pension expense both increase as the discount rate is reduced. Lowering the discount rate by 50 basis points (from 6.01% to 5.51%) would increase our pension liability at December 31, 2009 by approximately $243 million and increase our estimated 2010 pension expense by approximately $30 million. At December 31, 2009, we have unrecognized net actuarial losses of $1.2 billion related to our defined benefit pension plans. Our estimated 2010 expense related to our defined benefit pension plans of $215 million includes the recognition of approximately $87 million of these losses. Future changes in plan asset returns, plan provisions, assumed discount rates, pension funding law and various other factors related to the participants in our pension plans will impact our future pension expense and liabilities. We cannot predict with certainty what these factors will be in the future. Revenue Recognition. We recognize passenger revenue when transportation is provided or when the ticket expires unused, rather than when a ticket is sold. Revenue is recognized for unused non refundable tickets on the date of the intended flight if the passenger did not notify us of his or her intention to change the itinerary. The amount of passenger ticket sales not yet recognized as revenue is included in our consolidated balance sheets as air traffic and frequent flyer liability. We perform periodic evaluations of the estimated liability for passenger ticket sales and any adjustments, which can be significant, are included in results of operations for the periods in which the evaluations are completed. These adjustments relate primarily to differences between our statistical estimation of certain revenue transactions and the related sales price, as well as refunds, exchanges, interline transactions and other items for which final settlement occurs in periods subsequent to the sale of the related tickets at amounts other than the original sales price. Ticket change fees relate to non refundable tickets, but are considered a separate transaction from the air transportation because they represent a charge for our additional service to modify a previous sale. Ticket change fees are recognized as other revenue in our consolidated statement of operations at the time the fees are assessed. Frequent Flyer Accounting. For those OnePass accounts that have sufficient mileage credits to claim the lowest level of free travel, we record a liability for either the estimated incremental cost of providing travel awards that are expected to be redeemed with us or the contractual rate of expected redemption on alliance carriers. Incremental cost includes the cost of fuel, meals, insurance and miscellaneous supplies, less any fees charged to the passenger for redeeming the rewards, but does not include any costs for aircraft ownership, maintenance, labor or overhead allocation. We recorded an adjustment of $27 million to increase passenger revenue and reduce our frequent flyer liability during 2008 for the impact of redemption fees after we increased them during 2008. A change to these cost estimates, the actual redemption activity, the amount of redemptions on alliance carriers or the minimum award level could have a significant impact on our liability in the period of change as well as future years. The liability is adjusted periodically based on awards earned, awards redeemed, changes in the incremental costs and changes in the OnePass program, and is included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as air traffic and frequent flyer liability. Changes in the liability are recognized as passenger revenue in the period of change. We also sell mileage credits in our frequent flyer program to participating entities, such as credit/debit card companies, alliance carriers, hotels, car rental agencies, utilities and various shopping and gift merchants. Revenue from the sale of mileage credits is deferred and recognized as passenger revenue over the period when transportation is expected to be provided, based on estimates of its fair value. Amounts received in excess of the expected transportations fair value are recognized in income currently and classified as other revenue. A change to the time period over which the mileage credits are used (currently six to 26 months), the actual redemption activity or our estimate of the amount or fair value of expected transportation could have a significant impact on our revenue in the year of change as well as future years. Prior to joining Star Alliance in October 2009, we based our estimate of the fair value of transportation related to frequent flyer miles sold on the rates we charged other airlines. In connection with joining Star Alliance, we changed our estimate of the related transportations fair value to be based on the rate that is equivalent to the fare of a round trip ticket with restrictions similar to a frequent flyer reward. We made this change due to the disparate values of rates charged in reciprocal agreements with other Star Alliance members. The resulting fair values are generally higher than under our former estimates and will result in a larger portion of sales of OnePass miles being deferred and then amortized into passenger revenue and a lower portion being recognized as other revenue. During the year ended December 31, 2009, OnePass participants claimed approximately 1.3 million round trip awards. Frequent flyer awards accounted for an estimated 6.0% of our consolidated revenue passenger miles. We believe displacement of revenue passengers is minimal given our ability to manage frequent flyer inventory and the low ratio of OnePass award usage to revenue passenger miles. At December 31, 2009, we estimated that approximately 2.6 million free round trip travel awards outstanding were expected to be redeemed for free travel on Continental, Continental Express, Continental Connection, CMI or alliance airlines. Our total liability for future OnePass award redemptions for free travel and unrecognized revenue from sales of OnePass miles to other companies was approximately $348 million at December 31, 2009. This liability is recognized as a component of air traffic and frequent flyer liability in our consolidated balance sheets. Fair Value Measurements. We have certain assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis. ASC Subtopic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures (ASC Topic 820), clarifies that fair value is an exit price, representing the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants based on the highest and best use of the asset or liability. As such, fair value is a market based measurement that should be determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. ASC Topic 820 requires us to use valuation techniques to measure fair value that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. These inputs are prioritized as follows: Level 1: Observable inputs such as quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets Level 2: Other inputs that are observable directly or indirectly, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities or market corroborated inputs Level 3: Unobservable inputs for which there is little or no market data and which require us to develop our own assumptions about how market participants would price the assets or liabilities We have three items that are classified as Level 3: auction rate securities, a put right on certain auction rate securities and fuel hedging derivatives. The determination of the fair value of these items requires us to make critical assumptions. Student Loan Related Auction Rate Securities and Put Right. At December 31, 2009, we held student loan related auction rate securities with a fair value of $201 million and a par value of $252 million. These securities were classified as follows (in millions): Fair Value Par Value Amortized Cost Short term investments: Available for sale $136 $166 $136 Trading 65 86 N/A Total $201 $252 These securities are variable rate debt instruments with contractual maturities generally greater than ten years and whose interest rates are reset every 7, 28 or 35 days, depending on the terms of the particular instrument. These securities are secured by pools of student loans guaranteed by state designated guaranty agencies and reinsured by the U.S. government. All of the auction rate securities we hold are senior obligations under the applicable indentures authorizing the issuance of the securities. Auctions for these securities began failing in the first quarter of 2008 and have continued to fail, resulting in our holding such securities and the issuers of these securities paying interest adjusted to the maximum contractual rates. Prior to the first quarter of 2008, the carrying value of auction rate securities approximated fair value due to the frequent resetting of the interest rate and the existence of a liquid market. Although we will earn interest on these investments involved in failed auctions at the maximum contractual rate, the estimated market value of these auction rate securities no longer approximates par value due to the lack of liquidity in the market for these securities at their par value. We recorded losses totaling $60 million during 2008 to reflect the other than temporary decline in the fair value of these securities. These losses are included in nonoperating income (expense) in our consolidated statement of operations. Following this other than temporary impairment, a new amortized cost basis was established for available for sale securities equal to the then fair value. The difference between this amortized cost and the cash flows expected to be collected is being accreted as interest income. We estimated the fair value of these securities to be $201 million at December 31, 2009, taking into consideration the limited sales and offers to purchase securities and using internally developed models of the expected future cash flows related to the securities. Our models incorporated our probability weighted assumptions about the cash flows of the underlying student loans and discounts to reflect a lack of liquidity in the market for these securities. In addition, in 2008, one institution granted us a put right permitting us in 2010 to sell to the institution at their full par value auction rate securities with a par value of $125 million. The institution has also committed to loan us 75% of the market value of these securities at any time until the put right is exercised. The put right is recorded at fair value in prepayments and other assets on our consolidated balance sheet. We determined the fair value based on the difference between the risk adjusted discounted expected cash flows from the underlying auction rate securities without the put right and with the put right being exercised in 2010. We have classified the underlying auction rate securities as trading securities and elected the fair value option under the Fair Value Subsections of ASC Topic 825 10, Financial Instruments, for the put right, with changes in the fair value of the put right and the underlying auction rate securities recognized in earnings currently. During 2009, we sold, at par, auction rate securities having a par value of $40 million. Most of these securities were sold to the institution that had granted us the put right. We recognized gains on the sales using the specific identification method and recorded losses for the cancellation of the related put rights. The net gains are included in other non operating income (expense) in our consolidated statement of operations and were not material. We continue to monitor the market for auction rate securities and consider its impact, if any, on the fair value of our investments. If current market conditions deteriorate further, we may be required to record additional losses on these securities. Property and Equipment. As of December 31, 2009, the net carrying amount of our property and equipment was $7.4 billion, which represents 58% of our total assets. In addition to the original cost of these assets, the net carrying amount of our property and equipment is impacted by a number of accounting policy elections, including estimates, assumptions and judgments relative to capitalized costs, the estimation of useful lives and residual values and, when necessary, the recognition of asset impairment charges. Our property and equipment accounting policies are designed to depreciate our assets over their estimated useful lives and residual values of our aircraft, reflecting both historical experience and expectations regarding future operations, utilization and performance of our assets. In addition, our policies are designed to appropriately and consistently capitalize costs incurred to enhance, improve and extend the useful lives of our assets and expense those costs incurred to repair and maintain the existing condition of our aircraft. Capitalized costs increase the carrying values and depreciation expense of the related assets, which also impact our results of operations. Useful lives of aircraft are difficult to estimate due to a variety of factors, including technological advances that impact the efficiency of aircraft, changes in market or economic conditions and changes in laws or regulations affecting the airline industry. We evaluate the remaining useful lives of our aircraft when certain events occur that directly impact our assessment of the remaining useful lives of the aircraft and include changes in operating condition, functional capability and market and economic factors. Both depreciable lives and residual values are regularly reviewed for our aircraft and spare parts to recognize changes in our fleet plan and other relevant information. Jet aircraft and rotable spare parts are assumed to have estimated residual values of 15% and 10%, respectively, of original cost; other categories of property and equipment are assumed to have no residual value. A one year increase in the useful lives of our owned aircraft would reduce annual depreciation expense by approximately $12 million while a one year decrease would increase annual depreciation expense by approximately $12 million. A one percent decrease in residual value of our owned aircraft would increase annual depreciation expense by approximately $2 million. Impairments of Long Lived Assets. We record impairment losses on long lived assets, consisting principally of property and equipment and domestic airport operating rights, when events or changes in circumstances indicate, in managements judgment, that the assets might be impaired and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the carrying amount of those assets. Our cash flow estimates are based on historical results adjusted to reflect our best estimate of future market and operating conditions. The net carrying value of assets not recoverable is reduced to fair value if lower than the carrying value. In determining the fair market value of the assets, we consider market trends, recent transactions involving sales of similar assets and, if necessary, estimates of future discounted cash flows. We recorded a $31 million impairment charge on the Boeing 737 300 and 737 500 fleets in 2009 related to our decision in June 2008 to retire all of our Boeing 737 300 aircraft and a significant portion of our Boeing 737 500 fleet by early 2010. We recorded an initial impairment charge in 2008 for each of these fleet types. The additional write down in 2009 reflects the further reduction in the fair value of these fleet types in the then current economic environment. In both periods, we determined that indicators of impairment were present for these fleets. Fleet assets include owned aircraft, improvements on leased aircraft, rotable spare parts, spare engines and simulators. Based on our evaluations, we determined that the carrying amounts of these fleets were impaired and wrote them down to their estimated fair value. We estimated the fair values based on current market quotes and our expected proceeds from the sale of the assets. We recorded $39 million of other charges related to our mainline fleet, primarily related to the grounding and sale of Boeing 737 300 and 737 500 aircraft and the write off of certain obsolete spare parts. The 737 300 and 737 500 aircraft fleets and spare parts, a portion of which was being sold on consignment, experienced further declines in fair values during the fourth quarter of 2009 primarily as the result of additional 737 aircraft being grounded by other airlines. At December 31, 2009, we had four owned and three leased Boeing 737 500 aircraft that were grounded. We had also grounded seven owned and three leased Boeing 737 300 aircraft. The owned Boeing 737 500 and 737 300 aircraft are being carried at aggregate fair values of $33 million and $22 million, respectively. The three leased Boeing 737 300 aircraft were returned to the lessor in January 2010 and the leases on the three Boeing 737 500 aircraft will expire during the first half of 2012. We have also temporarily grounded 25 leased 37 seat ERJ 135 aircraft and have subleased five others for terms of five years. The leases on these 30 ERJ 135 aircraft expire in 2016 through 2018. We provide an allowance for spare parts inventory obsolescence over the remaining useful life of the related aircraft, plus allowances for spare parts currently identified as excess. These allowances are based on our estimates and industry trends, which are subject to change and, where available, reference to market rates and transactions. The estimates are more likely to change when we near the end of a fleet life or when we remove entire fleets from service sooner than originally planned. Impairments of Intangible Assets. We also perform annual impairment tests on our routes and international airport landing slots, which are indefinite life intangible assets, as of October 1 of each year. In prior years, we determined the fair value of each route by modeling the expected future discounted cash flows. If the calculated fair value was lower than the carrying value of a route, an impairment loss would have been recognized for the difference between the two amounts. With the adoption of new accounting rules, fair value is now determined as an exit price, representing the price that would be received in an orderly transaction between market participants based on the highest and best use of the asset, rather than as the result of an internally generated cash flow analysis. Our international route assets were recorded as part of our fresh start accounting when we emerged from bankruptcy in1993 rather than as the result of purchase transactions. These assets include both the value of the route and operating rights at the destination airports. Therefore, we consider the fair values of both the route authority and the airport operating rights when performing the annual impairment test for these assets. Certain of our international routes are to countries that are subject to open skies agreements, meaning that all carriers have access to any destination in that country. In these cases, if there are no significant barriers to new entrants to serve the international destination, such as airport slot restrictions or gate availability, there is no market for the route asset and, therefore, it has no fair value under the new definition of fair value. As a result, we recorded a $12 million non cash special charge in 2009 to write off our international routes to certain locations in Mexico and Central America. The other intangible assets established in 1993 were routes and airport operating rights for Paris, Madrid, Mexico City, Tokyo and CMIs network in the Pacific rim and Japan. In addition, we have acquired intangible assets in recent years through the purchase of slots at Londons Heathrow Airport. The carrying value of these indefinite lived intangible assets was $701 million at December 31, 2009. There have not been many market transactions involving these assets upon which to base fair values. Therefore, we determined the fair value of these assets using a discounted cash flow model based on our internal cash flow projections adjusted, where necessary, for differences between our underlying assumptions and those of other market participants. As a result of our analysis, we concluded that there was no impairment of our routes and international landing slots other than the $12 million we wrote off for routes having no fair value. Our analysis required us to make a number of assumptions about our future cash flows, our cost of capital and how other market participants would value the assets. While we believe that our assumptions are appropriate, changes in the assumptions could have a material effect on the results of our analysis and our conclusions. In 2008, we recorded an $18 million non cash charge to write off an intangible route asset as a result of our decision to move all of our flights between New York Liberty and London from London Gatwick Airport to London Heathrow Airport.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Market Risk Sensitive Instruments and Positions We are subject to certain market risks, including commodity price risk (i.e., aircraft fuel prices), interest rate risk, foreign currency risk and price changes related to certain investments in debt and equity securities. The adverse effects of potential changes in these market risks are discussed below. The sensitivity analyses presented do not consider the effects that such adverse changes may have on overall economic activity nor do they consider additional actions we may take to mitigate our exposure to such changes. Actual results may differ. See the notes to our consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8 of this report for a description of our accounting policies and other information related to these financial instruments. We do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Aircraft Fuel. Our results of operations are significantly impacted by changes in the price of aircraft fuel. During 2009 and 2008, aircraft fuel and related taxes accounted for 26.0% and 38.0%, respectively, of our operating expenses. Based on our expected fuel consumption in 2010, a one dollar increase in the price of crude oil will increase our annual fuel expense by approximately $41 million, before assuming no changes to the refining margins and our fuel hedging program. We routinely hedge a portion of our future fuel requirements, provided the hedges are expected to be cost effective. We have historically entered into swap agreements or purchased call options to protect us against sudden and significant increases in jet fuel prices. We conduct our fuel hedging activities using a combination of jet fuel, crude oil and heating oil contracts. We strive to maintain fuel hedging levels and exposure generally comparable to that of our major competitors, so that our fuel cost is not disproportionate to theirs. As of December 31, 2009, our projected fuel requirements for 2010 were hedged as follows: Maximum Price Minimum Price % of Expected Consumption Weighted Average Price (per gallon) % of Expected Consumption Weighted Average Price (per gallon) Gulf Coast jet fuel swaps 1% $1.94 1% $1.94 WTI crude oil swaps 2 1.84 2 1.84 WTI crude oil call options 4 2.20 N/A N/A Total 7% 3% At December 31, 2009, the fair value of our fuel derivatives was $14 million and is included in prepayments and other current assets in our consolidated balance sheet. We estimate that a 10% decrease in the price of crude oil and heating oil at December 31, 2009 would decrease the fair value of the fuel derivatives outstanding at that date by approximately $20 million. At December 31, 2008, our fuel derivatives were in a net loss position of $415 million resulting from the substantial decline in crude oil prices. This fair value is reported in accrued other current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet. Because our fuel hedges were in a net liability position at December 31, 2008, we were required to post cash collateral with our counterparties totaling $171 million. These amounts are reported in prepayments and other current assets in our consolidated balance sheet. Foreign Currency. We are exposed to the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on the U.S. dollar value of foreign currency denominated operating revenue and expenses. We have historically used foreign currency average rate options and forward contracts to hedge against the currency risk associated with our forecasted Japanese yen, British pound, Canadian dollar and euro denominated cash flows. At December 31, 2009, we had forward contracts outstanding to hedge 30% of our projected Japanese yen denominated cash inflows, primarily from passenger ticket sales, through 2010. At December 31, 2009, the fair value of those hedges was $5 million and is included in prepayments and other current assets in our consolidated balance sheet. We estimate that a uniform 10% strengthening in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to the Japanese yen at December 31, 2009 would increase the fair value for our yen hedges by $9 million and decrease our underlying exposure by $31 million, resulting in a net loss of $22 million. At December 31, 2008, we had forward contracts outstanding to hedge the following cash inflows (primarily from passenger ticket sales) in foreign currencies: 36% of our projected Japanese yen denominated cash inflows in 2009 6% of our projected euro denominated cash inflows in 2009 At December 31, 2008, the fair value of our foreign currency hedges was $(8) million and is included in accrued other liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet. Interest Rates. Our results of operations are affected by fluctuations in interest rates (e.g., interest expense on variable rate debt and interest income earned on short term investments). We had approximately $2.0 billion of variable rate debt as of December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008. If average interest rates increased by 100 basis points during 2010 as compared to 2009, our projected 2010 interest expense would increase by approximately $19 million after taking into account scheduled maturities. As of December 31, 2009 and 2008, we estimated the fair value of $4.1 billion and $3.7 billion (carrying value) of our fixed rate debt to be $4.0 billion and $3.0 billion, respectively, based upon discounted future cash flows using our current incremental borrowing rates for similar types of instruments or market prices. If market interest rates increased 100 basis points at December 31, 2009, the fair value of our fixed rate debt would decrease by approximately $106 million. A change in market interest rates would also impact interest income earned on our cash, cash equivalents and short term investments. Assuming our cash, cash equivalents and short term investments remain at their average 2009 levels, a 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would result in a corresponding increase or decrease in interest income of approximately $26 million during 2010. Investment Risk. Our short term investments primarily include certificates of deposit placed through an account registry service (\"CDARS\") and auction rate securities. While the CDARS are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the auction rate securities are secured by pools of student loans guaranteed by state designated guaranty agencies and reinsured by the U.S. government, we are subject to investment risk for the fair value of the investments. Our short term investments had a fair value of $310 million at December 31, 2009, including amounts that were classified as restricted cash, cash equivalents and short term investments. Our defined benefit plans had assets with a fair value of $1.4 billion at December 31, 2009, compared to a fair value of $1.1 billion at December 31, 2008. A significant portion of the plans assets consists of U.S. and international equities held through common collective trusts. Lower asset values can result in higher required contributions and pension expense in future years and a decrease in our stockholders equity.'"
